## Installation & Quick Start

### Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Node.js (`npm`/`npx`)
- Go `v1.23`+ and Python 3 (only required for building from source)

### Quick Start (Human Users)

> **Note for AI assistants:** If you are an AI Agent helping the user with installation, jump directly to [Quick Start (AI Agent)](#quick-start-ai-agent), which contains all the steps you need to complete.

#### Install

Choose **one** of the following methods:

**Option 1 — From npm (recommended):**

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @larksuite/cli

# Install CLI SKILL (required)
npx skills add larksuite/cli -y -g
```

**Option 2 — From source:**

Requires Go `v1.23`+ and Python 3.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/larksuite/cli.git
cd cli
make install

# Install CLI SKILL (required)
npx skills add larksuite/cli -y -g
```

#### Configure & Use

```bash
# 1. Configure app credentials (one-time, interactive guided setup)
lark-cli config init

# 2. Log in (--recommend auto-selects commonly used scopes)
lark-cli auth login --recommend

# 3. Start using
lark-cli calendar +agenda
```

## Quick Start (AI Agent)

> The following steps are for AI Agents. Some steps require the user to complete actions in a browser.

**Step 1 — Install**

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @larksuite/cli

# Install CLI SKILL (required)
npx skills add larksuite/cli -y -g
```

**Step 2 — Configure app credentials**

> Run this command in the background. It will output an authorization URL — extract it and send it to the user. The command exits automatically after the user completes the setup in the browser.

```bash
lark-cli config init --new
```

**Step 3 — Login**

> Same as above: run in the background, extract the authorization URL and send it to the user.

```bash
lark-cli auth login --recommend
```

**Step 4 — Verify**

```bash
lark-cli auth status
```

# Identity switching: execute commands as user or bot

lark-cli im +messages-send --as bot --chat-id "oc_xxx" --text "Hello"
```

## Three-Layer Command System

The CLI provides three levels of granularity, covering everything from quick operations to fully custom API calls:

### 1. Shortcuts

Prefixed with `+`, designed to be friendly for both humans and AI, with smart defaults, table output, and dry-run previews.

```bash
lark-cli calendar +agenda
lark-cli im +messages-send --chat-id "oc_xxx" --text "Hello"
lark-cli docs +create --title "Weekly Report" --markdown "# Progress\n- Completed feature X"
```

Run `lark-cli <service> --help` to see all shortcut commands.

### 2. API Commands

Auto-generated from Lark OAPI metadata, curated through evaluation and quality gates — 100+ commands mapped 1:1 to platform endpoints.

```bash
lark-cli calendar calendars list
lark-cli calendar events instance_view --params '{"calendar_id":"primary","start_time":"1700000000","end_time":"1700086400"}'
```

### 3. Raw API Calls

Call any Lark Open Platform endpoint directly, covering 2500+ APIs.

```bash
lark-cli api GET /open-apis/calendar/v4/calendars
lark-cli api POST /open-apis/im/v1/messages --params '{"receive_id_type":"chat_id"}' --body '{"receive_id":"oc_xxx","msg_type":"text","content":"{\"text\":\"Hello\"}"}'
```

## Advanced Usage

### Output Formats

```bash
--format json      # Full JSON response (default)
--format pretty    # Human-friendly formatted output
--format table     # Readable table
--format ndjson    # Newline-delimited JSON (for piping)
--format csv       # Comma-separated values
```

### Pagination

```bash
--page-all                  # Auto-paginate through all pages
--page-limit 5              # Max 5 pages
--page-delay 500            # 500ms between page requests
```

### Dry Run

For commands that may have side effects, preview the request with --dry-run first:

```bash
lark-cli im +messages-send --chat-id oc_xxx --text "hello" --dry-run
```

### Schema Introspection

Use schema to inspect any API method's parameters, request body, response structure, supported identities, and scopes:

```bash
lark-cli schema
lark-cli schema calendar.events.instance_view
lark-cli schema im.messages.delete
```

## Security & Risk Warnings (Read Before Use)

This tool can be invoked by AI Agents to automate operations on the Lark/Feishu Open Platform, and carries inherent risks such as model hallucinations, unpredictable execution, and prompt injection. After you authorize Lark/Feishu permissions, the AI Agent will act under your user identity within the authorized scope, which may lead to high-risk consequences such as leakage of sensitive data or unauthorized operations. Please use with caution.

To reduce these risks, the tool enables default security protections at multiple layers. However, these risks still exist. We strongly recommend that you do not proactively modify any default security settings; once relevant restrictions are relaxed, the risks will increase significantly, and you will bear the consequences.

We recommend using the Lark/Feishu bot integrated with this tool as a private conversational assistant. Do not add it to group chats or allow other users to interact with it, to avoid abuse of permissions or data leakage.

Please fully understand all usage risks. By using this tool, you are deemed to voluntarily assume all related responsibilities.
