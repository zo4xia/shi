## Core Concepts

- **Message**: A single message in a chat, identified by `message_id` (om_xxx). Supports types: text, post, image, file, audio, video, sticker, interactive (card), share_chat, share_user, merge_forward, etc.
- **Chat**: A group chat or P2P conversation, identified by `chat_id` (oc_xxx).
- **Thread**: A reply thread under a message, identified by `thread_id` (om_xxx or omt_xxx).
- **Reaction**: An emoji reaction on a message.

## Resource Relationships

```
Chat (oc_xxx)
├── Message (om_xxx)
│   ├── Thread (reply thread)
│   ├── Reaction (emoji)
│   └── Resource (image / file / video / audio)
└── Member (user / bot)
```

## Important Notes

### Identity and Token Mapping

- `--as user` means **user identity** and uses `user_access_token`. Calls run as the authorized end user, so permissions depend on both the app scopes and that user's own access to the target chat/message/resource.
- `--as bot` means **bot identity** and uses `tenant_access_token`. Calls run as the app bot, so behavior depends on the bot's membership, app visibility, availability range, and bot-specific scopes.
- If an IM API says it supports both `user` and `bot`, the token type changes who the operator is. The same API can succeed with one identity and fail with the other because owner/admin status, chat membership, tenant boundary, or app availability are checked against the current caller.

### Sender Name Resolution with Bot Identity

When using bot identity (`--as bot`) to fetch messages (e.g. `+chat-messages-list`, `+threads-messages-list`, `+messages-mget`), sender names may not be resolved (shown as open_id instead of display name). This happens when the bot cannot access the user's contact info.

**Root cause**: The bot's app visibility settings do not include the message sender, so the contact API returns no name.

**Solution**: Check the app's visibility settings in the Lark Developer Console — ensure the app's visible range covers the users whose names need to be resolved. Alternatively, use `--as user` to fetch messages with user identity, which typically has broader contact access.

### Card Messages (Interactive)

Card messages (`interactive` type) are not yet supported for compact conversion in event subscriptions. The raw event data will be returned instead, with a hint printed to stderr.
